<!--
How AngularJS integrates with HTML
ng mean angular
app mean app name
ng-app directive indicates the start of AngularJS application.
ng-model directive then creates a model variable named "name" which can be used with the html page and within the div having ng-app directive.
ng-bind then uses the name model to be displayed in the html span tag whenever user input something in the text box.
Closing</div> tag indicates the end of AngularJS application.
